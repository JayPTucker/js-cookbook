## Description:
UPDATED (3/24/20):

Welcome to J's Cookbook, a Project made by Jay Paul Tucker and Jeffrey McFarland.  This Website is simply a Recipe book, but not like any NORMAL one, with J's Cookbook, you're able to search for Recipe's based on the ingedients that you HAVE currently.  You'll get a list of 10 Recipe's based on what Ingredients you input into the search box near the top of the site.  You may click on any of the one's that appeal to you and get plenty of information on them.  We also grabbed another API in order to display the Weather at the Top-Right of your screen, but you have to allow access to your location right as you visit the website for the first time.

## Installation:
1. Clone the file from [The GitHub Repository](https://github.com/JayPTucker/js-cookbook)
2. Put it somewhere you'll remember (Best Choice for Easy Access: In a Folder on your Desktop)
3. Open GitBash and cd directly into the directory.
- "cd desktop" > "cd js-cookbook" > Done!
4. Once you're CD'd inside of the Repository, type "code ." into GitBash and hit Enter.
5. VSCode should open (Or any other Software you use to code).
6. From there, you have all your files you need to begin coding.
7. Have fun! Send us what you did!

## Usage:
UPDATED (3/24/20):

Once you load the Website for the first time you'll be prompted at the top right of your screen.  There will be a box asking if it can have access to your location so our Weather App may work, if you Allow Access, Weather information should appear at the top right of your screen under "Current Weather:", if not, then your router or computer is most likely blocking access to the API.

Below the Header you'll see a Search Box and some perameters to it.  All you have to do is type in the ingredients you want to find a Recipe for (Example: "Chocolate, Marshmellows, Sugar") each ingredient must be separated by a comma and a space.  Once you hit Search, or Enter, it will load up to 10 different Recipes for you to choose from.  Each have their own individual ingredients and instructions listed on them.
